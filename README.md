# learn

This is a Python code for image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. The code imports necessary libraries, defines the data directories, reads the labels, defines data generators and data iterators, creates a CNN model and a VGG16 model, compiles and trains the models, and evaluates them on the test set.

The code first sets the random seed to 42, which ensures that the results are reproducible. It then defines the data directories for the train, validation, and test sets.

The labels for the train, validation, and test sets are read using pandas read_csv() function. The labels are stored in separate dataframes with two columns: filename and label. The filename column contains the file name of the image and the label column contains the label of the image.

The code defines data generators for the train, validation, and test sets using the ImageDataGenerator class from the Keras library. The train_datagen object performs data augmentation on the training images by applying random rotations, zooms, shifts, shears, and flips. The val_datagen and test_datagen objects only rescale the validation and test images to values between 0 and 1.

The code creates data iterators for the train, validation, and test sets using the flow_from_dataframe() function from the ImageDataGenerator class. The train_iterator, val_iterator, and test_iterator objects generate batches of augmented and rescaled images and their labels. The target_size argument specifies the size of the images and the class_mode argument specifies that the labels are categorical.

The code then creates a CNN model with three convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, a flatten layer, two dense layers with ReLU activation function and a dropout layer, and a dense output layer with softmax activation function. The input shape of the first convolutional layer is (64,64,3), which corresponds to the size and number of color channels of the input images.

The code also creates a VGG16 model with the pre-trained weights from ImageNet and without the top layer. The base_model object is created using the VGG16() function with include_top=False and input_shape=(64,64,3) arguments. The weights of the base model are frozen by setting the trainable attribute of all its layers to False. The VGG16 model is then extended with a flatten layer, two dense layers with ReLU activation function and a dropout layer, and a dense output layer with softmax activation function.

Both models are compiled using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss function, and accuracy metric.

The code trains both models using the fit() function. However, the training of the models is commented out in this code.

Finally, the code evaluates both models on the test set using the evaluate() function and prints their loss and accuracy. However, the evaluation of the models is also commented out in this code.
